# AniMol
I am starting a python project to help me visually and numerically 
analyze my First-Principles Molecular Dynamics simulations using the 
Jupyter Notebook environment. This is also a learning experience for 
me as I have only just begun learning and using python for the last
3 months. This is in its infancy and will be built as I have time and
ability.

I have plans for visualizing molecules, animate their motions and 
interactions, calculate hessians and vibrational modes, and many more things.

I don't know where this project will take me but I'm excited for the journey.
